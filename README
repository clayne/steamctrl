steamctrl - Utility to setup Valve Steam Controller

This utility is meant to be used with the hid-steam Linux driver.
It can be used to disable and the mouse/keyboard emulation, as well as setup
a few other parameters.

If you want to run it automatically upon connection you can use a udev rule
such as the following:

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTR{uniq}=="?*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", RUN+="/usr/bin/steamctrl -s $attr{uniq} disable_keys_cursor disable_mouse

But note that this rule will not work without the hid-steam driver, because
it relies on the UNIQ value, and hid-generic doesn't set it.

Maybe you noticed that there are a few missing commands, for example, there is
'disable_keys_cursor' and 'disable_cursor', but not 'disable_keys'. I just
don't know how to do them.

If you know more about this kind of commands, please send a note to one of
these:

Thank you for your attention.
